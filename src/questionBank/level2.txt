Consider the following lines of code: int area; String name;  \n How many objects were created?
None – there is an object reference variable, but no object yet.
One – there is an object reference variable, so there must be an object.
Two – one for each variable.
Two – one for each class.
Three - one for each and helper class
0

What effect does it have if a class element (variable or method) has the modifier private?
If a class member is privatedeclared as , it can only be used at one point in the program.
If a class member is privatedeclared as , it can only be used by methods that are members of the class.
If a class member is privatedeclared as , it can only be used by private members of other classes.

Can a programmer design a class whose objects are immutable?
No, only a few predefined Java classes Stringare immutable.
No, all predefined classes are immutable and all classes defined by the programmer are not.
No, it is too hard
Yes, by privatedeclaring all instance variables of the class as declared and no accessor methods.

What are pseudo-random numbers as they are Random generated?
Pseudorandom numbers are numbers with various additional features.
Pseudo-random numbers are numbers that result in an equal distribution.
Pseudorandom numbers are less predictable than true random numbers.
Pseudo-random numbers look like random numbers in most applications, but they are generated by an algorithm and are completely predictable if you know the starting value.
None of the above

What does seed mean for a pseudo-random number generator?
seed names the random number generator.
seed initializes a particular stream of pseudorandom numbers that the generator generates.
seed determines the range of numbers the generator generates.
